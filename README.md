## 🖊️ My favorite code snippet
"my_filter" is a function in Python that takes a dictionary as a parameter.
It will return another dictionary that consists of the key/value pairs from the argument where the value has a length less than or equal to 3.
```
def my_filter(dictionary):
    return {key:dictionary[key] for key in dictionary if len(dictionary[key]) <= 3} 
```
